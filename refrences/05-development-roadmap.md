# Development Roadmap & Implementation Plan

*Step-by-step guide for building the Panthers NFT Telegram bot*

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)

### 1.1 Environment Setup
- [ ] Initialize Node.js project
- [ ] Install core dependencies (telegraf, secretjs, database)
- [ ] Set up development environment (testnet)
- [ ] Create basic project structure

### 1.2 Basic Telegram Bot
- [ ] Create bot with BotFather
- [ ] Implement basic commands (/start, /help)
- [ ] Set up command routing
- [ ] Test bot deployment

### 1.3 Database Schema
- [ ] Choose database (SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL for prod)
- [ ] Create user verification table
- [ ] Create challenge tracking table
- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations

**Deliverable:** Working Telegram bot with database integration

## Phase 2: Wallet Integration (Week 2)

### 2.1 Keplr Signature Flow
- [ ] Implement challenge generation
- [ ] Add signature verification logic
- [ ] Create user-friendly signing instructions
- [ ] Handle common signing errors

### 2.2 Secret Network Connection
- [ ] Set up SecretJS client
- [ ] Test basic contract queries
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Add network switching (testnet/mainnet)

### 2.3 Core Verification Logic
- [ ] Combine wallet auth + NFT ownership check
- [ ] Implement `/verify` command flow
- [ ] Add verification status tracking
- [ ] Test end-to-end verification

**Deliverable:** Working wallet connection and NFT verification

---

## Phase 3: Group Management (Week 3)

### 3.1 Telegram Group Integration
- [ ] Set up private Telegram group
- [ ] Add bot as group administrator
- [ ] Implement user invitation logic
- [ ] Test group membership management

### 3.2 Access Control System
- [ ] Link verification to group access
- [ ] Implement automatic group invites
- [ ] Add user removal on failed verification
- [ ] Handle edge cases (user already in group, etc.)

### 3.3 Update Mechanism
- [ ] Implement `/update` command
- [ ] Add global verification refresh
- [ ] Optimize batch user checking
- [ ] Add rate limiting and caching

**Deliverable:** Complete access control system

---

## Phase 4: Production Hardening (Week 4)

### 4.1 Security & Privacy
- [ ] Implement proper secret management
- [ ] Add request rate limiting
- [ ] Secure database connections
- [ ] Audit data storage practices

### 4.2 Error Handling & UX
- [ ] Comprehensive error messages
- [ ] User guidance improvements
- [ ] Fallback procedures
- [ ] Help documentation

### 4.3 Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Add application logging
- [ ] Implement health checks
- [ ] Set up error alerting
- [ ] Create admin dashboard (optional)

### 4.4 Deployment
- [ ] Production database setup
- [ ] Server deployment configuration
- [ ] Domain/SSL setup (if needed)
- [ ] Load testing

**Deliverable:** Production-ready bot

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Secret Network downtime** → Implement retry logic and graceful degradation
2. **Telegram API limits** → Add rate limiting and queue management
3. **Keplr compatibility issues** → Provide alternative signing methods
4. **Database scaling** → Design for horizontal scaling from start

### User Experience Risks
1. **Complex verification flow** → Extensive user testing and guidance
2. **Keplr learning curve** → Clear tutorials and support
3. **Network confusion** → Automatic network detection
4. **Lost access scenarios** → Re-verification procedures

### Security Risks
1. **Signature replay attacks** → Challenge expiration and nonce usage
2. **Database breaches** → Encryption and minimal data storage
3. **Bot token compromise** → Token rotation procedures
4. **Social engineering** → User education and verification
